Our intention is to Raise awareness of the researchers about open science and its main concepts ( as you can carry out your research in a more transparent and collaborative way) by creating a supportive network of like-minded individuals who are passionate about open science as We will measure our success by the number of engaged researchers and the number of researchers who will apply the Open science pillars. Besides that To build this community, we will need an enthusiastic and passionate team 
And help from the experts, further, 
Furthermore, We will try to get more contributors by searching for more expertise within the other OLS communities 
Finally, We plan to gain more users by Promoting the community on social media (Facebook & Linkedin)
